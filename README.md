TASK 1 - THE SPARKS FOUNDATION STUDENT SVORE PREDICTION USING SUPERVISED ML This is The 1st Task in The Internship of The Sparks Foundation in Data Science and Business Analytics The task is predicttion of percentage of students using Linear Regression Algorithm. The main process is training the model on the data of student scores to make a model can predict any student score based on study time in hours. The dataset contains two main columns: Hours: Which represent the student study time in hours. Scores: Which represent the student grade. The model has walk through these steps: Importing the necessary libraries ~ (Pandas, Numpy, Skicitlearn). Some EDA ~ (The Distribution of Scores, Regression Plot). Initialize the model for the training process ~ (Deviding and Splitting the data, fitting the LinearRegression model). Starting the prediction process. Comparing tThe actual label with the model predicted label. Evaulation
